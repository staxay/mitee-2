#Attitude Determination Code for MiTEE-2

###Written by: Sam Taxay
###Adapted from [MiTEE-1 OADCS Code](https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/mitee-oadcs/attitude-determination-for-mitee-1/-/tree/main/)

##What is this?

---

Before being implemented into the OADCS microcontroller onboard the MiTEE-2 satellite, the OADCS sub-team uses code like this to determine the attitude of MiTEE-2 while in space.

##Why does MiTEE-2 have different code than MiTEE-1?

---

While MiTEE-1 had well written code, MiTEE-2 uses a new method of attitude determination called QUEST rather than TRIAD, which was what MiTEE-1 used. 

##What is QUEST?

--- 

QUEST is an algorithm used to determine the attitude of a spacecraft. It is fairly simple, which is why we chose to implement it on MiTEE-2.

##Why is this being written?
